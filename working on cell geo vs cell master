new cells for cell assignment water areas: Do not use the one in the new cells for cell assignment geo. Replace it with the one in cell geo. 


I noticed that some water area cells in cell geo are 0 but when checked in cell master it is not zero but has a value. 
But upon comparing the cell geo from cell master: all new cells for cell assignment cells in cell geo and cell master 
have areas which are not zero. All the cells have water area values that are very close to each other, if you compare cell geo water areas
with cell master water areas. You must use the water areas in cell geo instead of in cell master though. It is better that way. The areas in cell master
seem to be rounded to integers and probably not good for computation. It is probably only for representation.
